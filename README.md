# Pathfinding Visualizer
This is a pathfinding visualizer built with Java Swing. Currently, it's able to visualize both the A* and Breadth-First Search pathfinding algorithms, both of which can be toggled using the dropdown menu in the application.\

To run the application, download the .jar file and run it.

# Controls

### Nodes
Start node: hold 's' & left click\
Goal node: hold 'r' & left click\
Create wall: left click & drag\

### Grid size
You can choose one of three different grid sizes using the slider.

Note: Changing the grid size will automatically reset and clear the grid at any stage of execution.

### Algorithm speed
You are able to change the speed of the algorithm as it's running using the speed slider.\

*Note:* BFS will be many times slower than A* so you will need to increase the speed of the BFS algorithm for it to be comparable to A*.

### Now visualize!
Press the Visualize button to visualize the algorithm!\
